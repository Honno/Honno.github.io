## About

Hello there, thanks for visiting my site! The above covers the basics, otherwise it's the typical "I like to create cool things" spiel. I'll let you decide if I suceed in that regard ;)

On my off-time (which I may too generously reward myself) I'm playing weird video games curiously or watching highbrow TV shows pretentiously. And when I'm doing the chores, it's podcasts. So many podcasts.

## What I've been up to

I'm working on my first video game right now. Slow going as I'm figuring out how to do things, and more-so when you shouldn't do things as a solo dev (but still do anyway, oops). I am quite excited for the future regardless, just there's not much to share yet~
