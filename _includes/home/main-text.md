Hello there, thanks for visiting my site!

About me? The above covers the basics, otherwise my bio is the typical "I like to create cool things" spiel --- I'll let you decide if I succeed in that regard.

## What I've been up to

I've got final year to get on with! Right now my focus is the overly-ambitious final year project I stupidly had to propose: a penetration test suite for RNG systems. I'm also searching for a job after graduation! <sub>Wanna hook me up?</sub>

## My projects

* ### 2019
  * **quine.gz**
    : [quine.gz](https://blog.matthewbarber.io/downloads/quine.gz){: class='file'}
    : [Source  (CRC)](https://github.com/Honno/metapp){: class='gh'}
    : [Article](https://blog.matthewbarber.io/2019/07/22/how-to-make-compressed-file-quines.html){: class='blog'}
    
    A GZIP file that decompresses to itself, ad infinitum. Involved the creation of an abstract Lempel-Ziv program that self-expands, which was carefully translated into a DEFLATE compressed data stream using the built-in fixed Huffman alphabet.
    
    Also required designing a multiprocessing Python script that can find a self-referential CRC32 value.
    
    I explain the whole process in an extensive blog article, which comes with numerous ASCII charts.
  
    * Python

  * **metapp** *(On hold)*
    : [Source](https://github.com/Honno/metapp){: class='gh'}

    Meta puzzle platformer about the nature of player/developer relationships. Level design inspired by [Karoshi](https://www.karoshigame.com/) and [100% Logical](https://gamejolt.com/games/100-logical/1268). Designed an auto-dialogue system with dynamic speech bubbles to improve the flow of narrative.
    
    Don't have enough time to see it to fruition at the moment :\(
